PURPOSE STATEMENT:

	This program is designed to take user inputs regarding workout information and store them appropriately in a database. The information required includes the workout date, the user's name, the muscle group target of the workout (is the workout a chest workout, arms, etc.?), the duration of the workout (in minutes), and the calories burned during the workout. Additionally, the program includes an optional daily calorie goal to be set, not to be stored in the database as these goals are subject to frequent change, and allows for the user to compare their recorded workouts to this goal.
	Upon launching the program, the user is able to view the workouts currently stored in the database, add a new workout, delete a previous workout, set a daily calorie goal, and compare their workouts to this goal for quick analysis of workout efficiency. Additionally, the menu allows the user the ability to call upon it at any time, should they need to view the menu options, and finally, to exit the program. All user inputs are organized into separate functions, split depending on purpose between the db.py file for database related functions and the ui.py file for user interface related functions, with two classes, "Workout" and "allWorkouts" stored on the business.py file.
